### Takes the built-in Spotify lyrics and gives them a complete uplift!

The background has been given a *Dynamic* Color Background that blends through the colors of the Cover-Art beautifully.

Lyrics have also been completely revamped to provide an entirely new a better Lyrics experience!

New Cinema and Page Lyric Views have been added to replace Spotifys own versions! Page view replaces the main-page and Cinema view gives you an immersive Lyrics experience!

## FAQ
- **The background isn't showing up! How come?**
	- Make sure that your Spicetify AND Spotify are updated to the most recent versions. Update Spicetify using these [instructions](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started/#updating) - to update Spotify click your PFP and if there is an option to update click it.
	- If you are on the latest versions then it must be an issue with the extension - so leave a report!
- **I have the extension but not the Right Side-Card! How do I get it?**
	- The right side-card is not a part of the extension - it's actually a built-in Spotify feature they haven't released! This is how you enable it:
		- Click your Profile Picture and click the "Expiremental Features" tab
		- Type into the search bar "side"
		- Click the checkmark for:
			- "Enable the view on the right sidebar"
			- "Extract background color based on artwork images"
			- "Enable Panel Size Coordination"
- **I just installed the extension, but I don't have any of the new stuff!**
	- If you are on Version 2.4.0 or greater the extension should automatically update itself to the latest version **as soon as the newest version comes out** - you don't have to wait for Spicetify to detect a new version - which could take up to *24 hours*!
- **The extension isn't doing anything at all!**
	- Make sure that your country doesn't have any internet-restrictions on JSDelivr (the website Spicetify uses to load the extensions). You'll find that other extensions won't work when installed through the Marketplace this way. If you are having this issue consider downloading the source of this extension and installing it locally (not through Marketplace).
