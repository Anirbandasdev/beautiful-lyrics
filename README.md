### Takes the built-in Spotify lyrics and gives them a complete uplift!

The background has been given a *Dynamic* Color Background that blends through the colors of the Cover-Art beautifully. Lyrics have also been given a more cleaner and satisfying appearance inspired by Apple Music.

Both the **Full-Screen** AND **Collapsed/Expanded Card** Lyrics are affected with these beautiful upgrades.
