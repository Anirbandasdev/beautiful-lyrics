### Takes the built-in Spotify lyrics and gives them a complete uplift!

The background has been given a *Dynamic* Color Background that blends through the colors of the Cover-Art beautifully. Lyrics have also been given a more cleaner and satisfying appearance inspired by Apple Music.

Both the **Full-Screen** AND **Side-Card** Lyrics are affected with these beautiful upgrades.

## FAQ
- **The background isn't showing up! How come?**
	- Make sure that your Spicetify AND Spotify are updated to the most recent versions. Update Spicetify using these [instructions](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started/#updating) - to update Spotify click your PFP and if there is an option to update click it.
	- If you are on the latest versions then it must be an issue with the extension - so leave a report!
- **I have the extension but not the Right Side-Card! How do I get it?**
	- The right side-card is not a part of the extension - it's actually a built-in Spotify feature they haven't released! This is how you enable it:
		- Click your Profile Picture and click the "Expiremental Features" tab
		- Type into the search bar "side"
		- Click the checkmark for:
			- "Enable the view on the right sidebar"
			- "Extract background color based on artwork images"
			- "Show lyrics in the right sidebar"
- **I just installed the extension, but I don't have any of the new stuff!**
	- The way the Spicetify Marketplace works is that there is a server that will grab the file for the extension - if it already grabbed it - it will keep the last version it grabbed for a little while (this could be a couple hours to a whole day). Then when someone comes along asking for it and the server doesn't want to have the old-version anymore it'll hand you the new version!<br><br>Luckily the latest version of the Extension - starting at 2.3.0 - comes with a built-in update-checker. If it detects an update is available it will let you know!
