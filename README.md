### Takes the built-in Spotify lyrics and gives them a complete uplift!

The background has been given a *Dynamic* Color Background that blends through the colors of the Cover-Art beautifully. Lyrics have also been given a more cleaner and satisfying appearance inspired by Apple Music.

Both the **Full-Screen** AND **Collapsed/Expanded Card** Lyrics are affected with these beautiful upgrades.

## FAQ
- **The background isn't showing up! How come?**
	- Make sure that your Spicetify AND Spotify are updated to the most recent versions. Update Spicetify using these [instructions](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started/#updating) - to update Spotify click your PFP and if there is an option to update click it.
	- If you are on the latest versions then it must be an issue with the extension - so leave a report!
